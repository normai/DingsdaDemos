# Project Interdingsda

This project demonstrates the use of abstract classes and interfaces.

### Abstract method

### Virtual method

### Interface

### Type casting


### Notes

 Todo : Class Dingsda was only created to have one type which can be used
 as mother type of all. The .NET provides such class as 'Object',
 but I avoided that class, just for not so convincing reasons.
 Now I think I shoule rather **eliminate the Dingsda class**,
 and leave it's job to Object.
 (1) This would allow demo code lines like casting from dedicated type
 to Object and back from Object to dedicated type, which is an actual real-world demand.
 (2) It would make the UML diagram simpler and more clearly telling,
  that Vehicles and Dragons have nothing in common except the interface.

 Todo : Not all methods are use so far, e.g. Park(), Clean(). Use them.
